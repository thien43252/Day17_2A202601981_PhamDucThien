`<USER_SUMMARY> Minh is working on a benchmark report for an open loop LAB-REPORT-1600, due Friday at 4:00 PM. For the company project BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS, and Python is not to be used for this project's backend. Minh uses Python for personal demos, such as ORCHID-27. Minh is debugging async HTTP and found that reusing the aiohttp ClientSession and setting concurrency to 20 is an effective solution for connection churn, rather than increasing the timeout, which is related to the ASYNC-FIX-20 incident.  Minh prefers Python and dislikes Java. When explaining code, Minh prefers short examples. Minh is currently learning about async/await and often confuses co`
